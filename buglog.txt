Checkpoint 1:

IDT does not work with correct setting up exception and intterrupt data structure. 
-FIX: load the IDT address wrongly into idtr, change to correct parameter idt_desc_ptr.

Keyboard can only interrupt once, after mapping to the correct port in idt. 
-FIX: add assembly wrapper to the keyboard handler function

RTC only interrupt once after rtc handler is called. 
-FIX: force to clear the rtc data port.

Checkpoint 2:

Cursor did not at correct position after ENTER (newline_cursor) has been pressed. 
-FIX: decrement terminal's x position at the begining of the function.

When the cursor reaching the bottom row of terminal, the terminal update the screen wrongly. 
-FIX: change the boundary check of the cursor's position

After pressing CTRL, press l solely will automatically clear the screen.
-FIX: Make CTRL flag back to 0 after clearing the screen each time.

Checkpoint 3:

ESP,EBP are wrongly stored and restored. 
-FIX: change the process ID number with correct value. PCB should store parent ESP&EBP. 

Stdin for shell does not work properly. Shell always wait for input even after we press enter.  
-FIX: Instead of only one line_buffer for input before enter, we implement another terminal_buffer which will be set whenever we press enter.

Checkpoint 4:
The execute function can not get argument correctly. 
-FIX: does not put 0x20 ASCII (' ') character in the scancode lookup table.

The argument is not place in the correct position in the buffer. 
-FIX: modify the argument offset by plus 1

Pingpong stopped after printing single “A” ­
-FIX:RTC did not sti and cli in Rtc_read. Add sti and cli in rtc_read.

Global varible seems to be changed during exexcution. For example, while executing file fish, the first element uint8_t* fname = "frame0.txt" is always null. At the begginning, it is really hard to debug it since gdb give nothing but that variable is wrong. However, there is a paradox since file of fish stored in file system could not be wrong. 
-FIX: We finally found the bug is located in file_read, which behave wrongly while reaching boundary.

Checkpoint 5:

After switch the terminal, the keyboard interrupt is disabled. 
-FIX: forget to send eoi after executing a new "shell"
